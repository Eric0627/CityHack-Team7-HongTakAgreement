     Financial guarantees 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Company has issued corporate guarantees to banks for bank borrowings of its subsidiary 
     
     corporations. These guarantees are financial guarantees as they require the Company to reimburse the 
     
     banks if the subsidiary corporations fail to make principal or interest payments when due in accordance 
     
     with the terms of their borrowingst 
     
    
   
   
    
     Financial guarantees are initially recognised at their fair values plus transaction costs in the Company’s 
     
     statement of financial position. Financial guarantees are subsequently amortised to profit or loss over the 
     
     period of the subsidiary corporations’ borrowings, unless it is probable that the Company will reimburse 
     
     the banks for an amount higher than the unamortised amount In this case, the financial guarantees shall 
     
     be carried at the expected amount payable to the banks in the Company’s statement of financial position. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Intraegroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
     
     Borrowings 
     
    
   
   
    
     Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer 
     
     settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period, in which case they are presented 
     
     as non-current liabilitiest 
     
    
   
   
    
     Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value (net of transaction costs) and subsequently carried at 
     
     amortised costt Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
     
     value is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest methodt 
     
    
   
   
    
     Trade and other payables 
     
    
   
   
    
     Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the 
     
     end of financial year which are unpaid. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 
     
     one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). Otherwise, they are presented 
     
     as non-current liabilities. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortised cost 
     
     using the effective interest method. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Provisions 
     
    
   
   
    
     Provisions for other liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
     
     constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources 
     
     will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimatedt Provision are not 
     
     recognised for future operating losses. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the 
     
     obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of 
     
     money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time 
     
     is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as finance expense
