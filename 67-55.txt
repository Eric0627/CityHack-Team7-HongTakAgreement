     Impairment 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence 
     
     that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and recognises an allowance for 
     
     impairment when such evidence exists.

     Loans and receivables 
     
    
   
   
    
     Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy 
     
     and default or significant delay in payments are objective evidence that these financial 
     
     assets are impaired. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The carrying amount of these assets is reduced through the use of an impairment allowance 
     
     account which is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present 
     
     value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate, When 
     
     the asset becomes uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account, Subsequent 
     
     recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised against the same line item in 
     
     profit or loss 
     
    
   
   
    
     The impairment allowance is reduced through profit or loss in a subsequent period when 
     
     the amount of impairment loss decreases and the related decrease can be objectively 
     
     measured. The carrying amount of the asset previously impaired is increased to the extent 
     
     that the new carrying amount does not exceed the amortised cost had no impairment been 
     
     recognised in prior periods. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Availab/e-for-sa/e financial assets 
     
    
   
   
    
     In addition to the objective evidence of impairment described above, a significant or 
     
     prolonged decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered as an 
     
     indicator that the available-for-sale financial asset is impaired. 
     
    
   
   
    
     If there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other 
     
     comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss‘ The amount of cumulative 
     
     loss that is reclassified is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost (net of 
     
     any principal repayments and amortisation) and the current fair value. less any impairment 
     
     loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss. The impairment losses 
     
     recognised as an expense on equity securities are not reversed through profit or loss in 
     
     subsequent periodt 
     
    
   
   
    
     Offsetting ﬁnancial instruments 
     
    
   
   
    
     Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial 
     
     position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle on a 
     
     net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
