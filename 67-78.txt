     Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that realisation of 
     
     the related tax benefits through future taxable profits is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses 
     
     of approximately $517,000 (2016: $Nil) at the balance sheet date which can be carried forward and used 
     
     to offset against future taxable income subject to the agreement of the tax authority and compliance with 
     
     certain statutory requirements. The tax losses have no expiry date.
