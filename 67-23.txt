     Level and Mix of Remuneration (Continued) 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Company’s Executive Directors, are remunerated based on their service agreements As per the 
     
     terms of the service agreements, either party may terminate the service agreement by giving to the other 
     
     party not less than six (6) months’ notice in writing, or in lieu of notice, payment of an amount equivalent 
     
     to siX (6) months’ salary based on their last drawn monthly salary The remuneration for each of Mr 
     
     Lee Koh Yong and Mr Lee Cheng Chye comprises a fixed salary, monthly car allowance, fixed bonus 
     
     of one month‘s salary as well as profit sharing which is designed to align the interests of the Executive 
     
     Directors with those of shareholders. The Company currently does not have any contractual provisions 
     
     which allow it to reclaim incentives from the Executive Directors in certain circumstances. The Board is 
     
     of the view that as the Group pays performance bonuses based on the actual performance of the Group 
     
     and/or Company (and not on forward-Iooking results) as well as actual results of its Executive Directors, 
     
     clawebacw provisions in the service agreements may not be relevant or appropriate. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Group had also previously entered into letters of employment with all the key management personnel, 
     
     Such letters typically provide for the salaries payable to the key management personnel, their working 
     
     hours, medical benefits, grounds of termination and certain restrictive covenants. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The review of the remuneration of the key management personnel takes into consideration the 
     
     performance and the contributions of the key management personnel to the Group and gives clue regard 
     
     to the financial and business performance of the Group of which performance conditions is not pre- 
     
     determined} The Remuneration Committee has reviewed and is satisfied that the performance conditions 
     
     were met for FY2017. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Company’s remuneration policy which covers all aspects of remuneration, including but not limited 
     
     to directors&#39; fees, salaries, allowances, benefits-in-kind and bonuses is one that seeks to attract, retain 
     
     and motivate talent to achieve the Company’s business vision and create sustainable value for its 
     
     stakeholders. The policy articulates to the staff the link that total compensation has to the achievement of 
     
     organizational and individual performance objectives, and benchmarked against relevant and comparative 
     
     compensation in the market.
