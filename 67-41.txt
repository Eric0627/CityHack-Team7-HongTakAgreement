     Key audit matter 
     
    
   
   
    
     How our audit addressed the matter 
     
    
   
   
    
       
     
    
   
   
    
     Revenue recognition 
     
    
   
   
    
     Revenue from rendering of services is recognised 
     
     and accrued with reference to the sewices performed 
     
     according to contract agreements. 
     
    
   
   
    
     We focus on this area as there is a presumed high 
     
     risk with regards to revenue recognition and it involves 
     
     management’s estimate in calculating the accrued 
     
     revenue and there is inherent risk that revenue may not 
     
     be recognised in the proper accounting period. 
     
    
   
   
    
     In obtaining sufficient audit evidence, the following 
     
     procedures were carried out: 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Obtained an understanding and evaiuation of the design 
     
     and implementation of key controis over the revenue 
     
     recognition, on sample basis, to determine whether 
     
     these controls were operating effectively throughout the 
     
     financial year. 
     
    
   
   
    
     0 On a sample basis, we checked to the contract 
     
     agreements for the rates applied, and supporting 
     
     documents to ascertain the occurrences of services 
     
     rendered. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - For material items within accrued revenue we 
     
     reperformed the calculation of the revenue that had 
     
     been earned to ascertain the accuracy of the accrued 
     
     revenue recorded by management. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Analysed revenue trends and corroborated unusual 
     
     movements. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Performed cut—off testing to ascertain that revenue has 
     
     been recognised in the proper accounting period. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Reviewed significant and unusual credit notes issued 
     
     during the financial year and subsequent to the year end. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - In performing our journal testing, we paid increased 
     
     attention to entries impacting revenue, particularly those 
     
     raised close to the end of the reporting period.
