     ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
     
    
   
   
    
     FINANCIAL REVIEW 
     
    
   
   
    
       
     
    
   
   
    
     The Group delivered a stable performance for the 
     
     financial year ended 30 June 2017 (“FY2017). Revenue 
     
     grew by 0.3% to 8351569 million in FY2017, contributed 
     
     by the award of new contracts. notwithstanding the 
     
     completion of certain cleaning contracts. 
     
    
   
   
    
     In tandem with its continual cost management efforts, the 
     
     Group saw a 10.2% decline in purchases of supplies and 
     
     disposal charges to 83323.7 million from S$26.4 million 
     
     in FY2016. Employee benefits expenses increased by 
     
     S$2.2 million or 2.9% from S$76.7 million in FY2016 to 
     
     85878.9 million in FY2017 as a result of a reduced level 
     
     of government grant. Other expenses decreased by 
     
     S$1.4 million or 6.2% from S$22.6 million in FY2016 
     
     t0 S$21.2 million in FY2017. The decrease stemmed 
     
     primarily from lower foreign worker levies in line with 
     
     a decrease in foreign worker headcount and decrease 
     
     in upkeep of motor vehicles. The investments in the 
     
     truck depot located in Tuas South and additional motor 
     
     vehicles and machinery made to support the Group’s 
     
     business operations resulted in depreciation expense 
     
     increasing by S$0.8 million or 9.8% from S$82 million 
     
     in FY2016 to S$9.0 million in FY2017. 
     
    
   
   
    
     As a result of the above, the Group reported a net profit 
     
     attributable to shareholders of S$17.1 million in FY2017 
     
     as compared to S$16,7 million in FY2016. Earnings per 
     
     share were 9.58 Singapore cents for FY2017 compared 
     
     to 936 Singapore cents for FY2016. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Shareholders equity increased by 823109 million from 
     
     S$70.4 million as at 30 June 2016 to 83381.3 million as 
     
     at 30 June 2017. The increase was contributed mainly 
     
     by the Group’s net earnings attributable to equity holders 
     
     of the Company of S$17.1 million in FY2017 which was 
     
     partially offset by dividend payments of S$6.2 million. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Group had net current assets of S$23.7 million as 
     
     at 30 June 2017, an increase of $332.6 million from 
     
     S$21.1 million as at 30 June 2016. Current assets 
     
     increased by S$1.9 million between FY2016 and FY2017 
     
     mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
     
     of S$4.5 million offset by a decrease in trade and other 
     
     receivables 01 S$3.2 million, reflective of an improved 
     
     receivables collection cycle in FY2017. Current liabilities 
     
     decreased by S$0.8 million due to a decrease in trade 
     
     and other payables of S$1.0 million for the payment of 
     
     key plant components for the construction of the waste 
     
     to energy (“WTE) plant in Tuas South. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Non-current assets amounted to 8251009 million as 
     
     at 30 June 2017 as compared to S$85.2 million as at 
     
     30 June 2016. The increase of S$15.7 million was largely 
     
     due to the construction of the WTE plant and sludge 
     
     treatment facility in Tuas South which was capitalised 
     
     as construction-in-progress.
