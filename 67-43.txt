     Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued) 
     
    
   
   
    
     0 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
     
     appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
     
     Group’s internal controlt 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
     
     related disclosures made by management. 
     
    
   
   
    
     0 Conclude 0n the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
     
     on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
     
     cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern If we conclude that a material 
     
     uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
     
     financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
     
     on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report However, future events or conditions may 
     
     cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
     
     and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
     
     fair presentation. 
     
    
   
   
    
     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
     
     within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the 
     
     direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion, 
     
    
   
   
    
     We communicate wlth the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
     
     significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
     
    
   
   
    
     We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
     
     independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
     
     bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
     
    
   
   
    
     From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in 
     
     the audit of the financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters} We describe these 
     
     matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
     
     extremely rare circumstances. we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
     
     adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
     
     communication
