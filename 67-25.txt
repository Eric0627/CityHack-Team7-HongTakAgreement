     The aggregate remuneration paid to the top five key management personnel of the Group (excluding the 
     
     Directors and the CEO) was approximately S$1,182,000 in FY2011 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Company is of the view that due to the confidentiality of and commercial sensitivity attached to 
     
     remuneration matters as well as a competitive business and human resource environment, the disclosure 
     
     of the remuneration of each Executive Director and key management personnel would be prejudicial to 
     
    
   
   
    
     its business interest.
