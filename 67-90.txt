     The Group and the Company are in compliance with all externally imposed capital requirements 
     
     for the financial years ended 30 June 2017 and 2016. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Fair value measurement 
     
    
   
   
    
     The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (availabIe-for-sale equity securities) is 
     
     based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for 
     
     financiai assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in Level 1 of 
     
     the fair value hierarchy, in which assets are measured at fair value based on quoted prices (unadjusted) 
     
     in active markets for identical assets. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The following table presents assets that measured at fair value at 80 June:

     The carrying amount less impairment allowance of trade receivables and payables are assumed to 
     
     approximate their fair values. The carrying amounts of borrowings are reasonable approximation of their 
     
     respective fair values, either due to their short-term nature or that they are floating rate instruments that 
     
     are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the reporting date.
