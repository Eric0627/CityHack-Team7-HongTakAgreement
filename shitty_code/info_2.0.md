## Approaches

To find the entity name of one entity, we only need to sear in the first three pages. The name will either be in the title of the document or in the description of the document. 

The most important information lies in the auditor's part and the financial statements. Generally,there will be related word(s) indicating that one section may is related to auditing or financial report. 

As convention, auditors will explicitly state which part is their opinion, and they will also indicate the audit period. Finally, one auditing partner will sign on his/her report, and here is where the auditor name can be founded. 

As for the financial data, they can be explicitly found in the Income Statement (which may have different name in different companies' report)


## Difficulties

OCR result is not good.
