     Transactions and balances 
     
    
   
   
    
     Transactions in a currency other than the functional currency (“foreign currency”) are translated 
     
     into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Currency 
     
     exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
     
     of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the 
     
     end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss. However, in the consolidated financial 
     
     statements, currency translation differences arising from borrowings in foreign currencies and other 
     
     currency instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges and net investment 
     
     in foreign operations, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
     
     currency translation reserve. 
     
    
   
   
    
     When a foreign operation is disposed of or any loan forming part of the net investment of the 
     
     foreign operation is repaid, a proportionate share of the accumulated currency translation 
     
     differences is reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal, 
     
    
   
   
    
     Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in profit or loss within 
     
     “finance expenses”, All other foreign exchange gains and losses impacting profit or loss are 
     
     presented in profit or loss within “other losses — net”. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Non-monetary items measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange 
     
     rates at the date when the fair values are determined. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Translation of Group entitles’ ﬁnancial statements 
     
    
   
   
    
     The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a 
     
     hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
     
     are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
     
    
   
   
    
     (i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the reporting date; 
     
    
   
   
    
     (ii) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless the average is not a 
     
     reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction 
     
     dates, in which case income and expenses are translated using the exchange rates at the 
     
     dates of the transactions); and 
     
    
   
   
    
     (iii) all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income 
     
     and accumulated in the currency translation reserve These currency translation differences 
     
     are reclassified to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the entity giving rise to 
     
     such reserve. 
     
    
   
   
    
     2.17 Cash and cash equivalents 
     
    
   
   
    
     For the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows, cash and cash equivalents 
     
     include cash on hand, cash and cash deposits held with financial institutions which are subject to an 
     
     insignificant risk of change in value.
