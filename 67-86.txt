     (iii) Cash ﬂow and fair value interest rate risk 
     
     Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
     
     fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk 
     
     that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. 
     
     The Group’s exposure to interest rates relates primarily to interest-eaming financial assets and 
     
     interest-bearing financial liabilities. 
     
     The Group&#39;s exposure to cash flow interest rate risks arises mainly from non-current borrowings 
     
     at variable rates, 
     
     The Group’s borrowings at variable rates are denominated in SGD. It the SGD interest rates 
     
     increase/decrease by 0.5% (2016: 0.5%) with all other variables including tax rate is being held 
     
     constant, the net profit will be lower/higher by $128,000 (2016: $68,000) as a result of higher/lower 
     
     interest expense on these borrowings. 
     
     Sensitivity analysis 
     
     Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments 
     
     The Group is not exposed to changes in interest rates for fixed rate financial assets and financial 
     
     liabilities 
     
    

    
     Credit risk 
     
    
   
   
    
     Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in 
     
     financial loss to the Group, The major classes of financial assets of the Group are cash and cash 
     
     equivalents, trade receivables and unbilled receivables. For trade receivables, the Group adopts the 
     
     policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history. For other financial assets, the Group 
     
     adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties. 
     
    
   
   
    
     As the Group and the Company do not hold any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk for each 
     
     class of financial instruments is the carrying amount of that class of financial instruments presented on 
     
     the statement of financial position, except as follows:
