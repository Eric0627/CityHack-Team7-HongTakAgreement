     (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
     
    
   
   
    
     Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight—line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
     
     Management estimates the useful lives of these property, plant and equipment, except for leasehold land 
     
     and leasehold buildings and improvements, to be within 3 to 10 years. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Changes In the expected level of usage and technological development could impact the economic useful 
     
     lives of these assets; therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised‘ If the actual useful lives of 
     
     these items of property, plant and equipment were to differ by 10% from management&#39;s estimates, the 
     
     carrytng amounts of the property, plant and equipment would be an estimated $679,000 (2016: $629,000) 
     
     higher or lower. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The carwing amounts of property, plant and equipment are disclosed in Note 10 to the financial 
     
     statements.
