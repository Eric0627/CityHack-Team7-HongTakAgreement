     Allowance for impairment is recognised against trade receivables based on estimated irrecoverable 
     
     amounts determined by reference to past default experience. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Except for the amounts which allowance for impairment have been made, management believes 
     
     that the amounts that are past due are collectible, based on historic payment behaviour and 
     
     credit-worthiness 0f the customers. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Liquidity risk 
     
    
   
   
    
     Prudent \iquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities. the 
     
     availabllity of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities (Note 12) and the ability 
     
     to close out market positions at a short notice. At the end of the reporting period, assets held by the 
     
     Group and the Company for managing liquidity risk included cash and short-term deposits as disclosed 
     
     in Note 4. 
     
    
   
   
    
     The table below analyses the Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity 
     
     groupings based on the remaining period from the end of the reporting period to the contractual maturity 
     
     date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due 
     
     within 12 months equal their carrying amounts as the impact of discounting is not expected to be 
     
     signiﬁcant.
