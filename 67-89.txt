     The Group&#39;s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s abmty to continue as a going 
     
     concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholder value. In order to 
     
     malntain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders or obtain 
     
    
   
   
    
     new borrowings. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Management monitors capital based on a gearing ratio and compliance of externally imposed capital 
     
     requirements. The Group’s strategies, are to maintain: (i) gearing ratio not exceeding 200%; and (ii) net 
     
     worth at not less than $20 million at all times 
     
    
   
   
    
     (I) Gearing ratio 
     
    
   
   
    
     The gearing ratio is calculated as total liabilities divided by net worth.
