     Save as disclosed above, there is no other employee of the Group who is an immediate family member 
     
     of a Director or the CEO whose remuneration exceeded S$50,000 in FY2017. 
     
    
   
   
    
     Currently, the Company does not have any employee share option schemes or other short-term and 
     
     Iong-term incentive schemes for the Directors and key management personnel, save as disclosed for the 
     
     Executive Chairman and CEO who are entitled to profit sharing to be paid after the audited consolidated 
     
     accounts of the Group have been approved at the annual general meeting of the Company, The profit 
     
     sharing is computed based on the Group’s audited consolidated profit before deducting income tax 
     
     expense, non-recurring or one-off exceptional items, non-controlling interests of the Group and before 
     
     paying the profit sharing (“Profit Before Taxation”). 
     
    
   
   
    
     The Remuneration Committee is of the view that the audited Profit Before Taxation reflects the financial 
     
     performance of the Group’s business and is also a key performance measure which allows for general 
     
     comparabiiity of performance. In FY2017, the Group had achieved the performance objectives for both 
     
     the Executive Chairman and CEO to be entitled to profit sharing.
